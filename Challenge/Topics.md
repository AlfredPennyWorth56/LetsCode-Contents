The best way to improve your programming skills is to practice. Therefore, the idea is to start a common project where each of you will be in charge of parts of the code and will need to interact with others so as to make sure the whole thing works.

First steps is to come up with some ideas. Feel free to contribute directly in this file without erasing the proposals of your fellow developers.
